Introduction: \
For this final project, the bank_marketing.csv dataset was used to perform a secondary data analysis. This dataset provides information about marketing campaigns from a European bank. The dataset includes variables for age, job, marital status, education level, loan default status (i.e., yes/no), account balance, whether the loan is for housing (i.e., yes/no) or personal (i.e., yes/no), as well as information on the most recent bank outreach campaign, including contact method (i.e., cellular, telephone, unknown, Nan), last day of the month contaced, last month contacted, duration of last contact, number of contacts during current campaign, number of previous contacts (before the current campaign), outcome of the previous campaign, and whether the client has subscribed to a term deposit (i.e., yes/no).
The goals of this project are to import and transform a raw dataset, perform exploratory and descriptive analysis, provide appropriate visualizations, and apply analytic models on the data.
The main question being explored is whether one or more features--including demographics like age and education level, and previous campaign results--can be used to predict whether a bank client will take out a deposit. A secondary question being explored is how factors like age, marital status, education level, account balance, and loan status affect defaulting on a loan from this European bank.
Logistic regression models will be used to explore the relationship between the specified independent varibales and dependent variable for each question.
